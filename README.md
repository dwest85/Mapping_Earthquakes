# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Overview
* This repository provides an interactive web map with multiple layers and overlays that provide the user with earthquake data from the last 7 days. This data is measured by the magnitude and then ordered by color and radius. The additional overlay information shows the tectonic plate map, in order to show the pattern of earthquakes, as well as an overlay showing major earthquakes. 

# Folder Structure
* The finished map is located in the Earthquake_Challenge folder.
